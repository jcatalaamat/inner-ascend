        "content": "A core wound is not just a bad memory. It's a belief about yourself that was formed before you had language to question it.\n\nMost core wounds form between ages 0-7, in moments when your developing brain needed to make sense of confusing or painful experiences. You were too young to think, 'My parent is having a hard day and is projecting their stress onto me.' Instead, you thought, 'I did something wrong. I am bad.'\n\nThat belief—'I am bad,' 'I am not enough,' 'I am unlovable,' 'I cannot trust'—became your core wound. It settled into your nervous system, your body, your sense of self. And from that day forward, you filtered reality through that belief.\n\nCore wounds are not your fault. They are the result of a child's brain trying to survive in an imperfect world. But now, as an adult, they run your life from the shadows. They determine how you react to criticism, how you show up in relationships, what you believe you deserve, and what you're afraid to risk.\n\nThe good news: What was learned can be unlearned. What was formed can be reformed. But first, you must identify the wound. You must bring it into the light. That's the work of this module.",

        "content": "While each person's experience is unique, research in developmental psychology has identified five core wound types that most people carry. These are based on Lise Bourbeau's work and validated across countless therapeutic approaches.\n\n1. REJECTION - 'I don't belong': The belief that you are fundamentally unwanted or that there's something wrong with who you are at your core. Often forms when a child feels rejected for simply existing.\n\n2. ABANDONMENT - 'I will be left': The terror of being alone or left behind. This wound creates desperate clinging or preemptive abandonment of others before they can leave you.\n\n3. HUMILIATION - 'I am shameful': The belief that you are inherently dirty, wrong, or disgusting. Often forms around bodily functions, sexuality, or needs being shamed.\n\n4. BETRAYAL - 'I cannot trust': The wound that forms when trust is broken by someone you depended on. Creates hypervigilance and difficulty surrendering control.\n\n5. INJUSTICE - 'I am not treated fairly': The wound of not being seen, valued, or treated with fairness. Creates rigid perfectionism and emotional coldness.\n\nMost people have one or two primary wounds, with others as secondary. Each wound creates its own protective 'mask'—a personality adaptation designed to prevent the wound from being triggered.",

Betrayed? Not seen? The pattern that repeats across multiple relationships points to your core wound.\n\nEMOTIONAL TRIGGERS: What makes you disproportionately reactive? When do you go from 0 to 100 emotionally? The trigger is often touching your wound.\n\nSOMATIC RESPONSES: Where does your body contract or guard when you're stressed? Your wound lives in your body as much as your mind.\n\nCHILDHOOD MEMORIES: What's your earliest painful memory? While one event doesn't create a wound, the earliest memory often points to the wound's theme.\n\nSELF-BELIEFS: Complete this sentence: 'Deep down, I'm afraid I am...' The word that comes up is often your core wound speaking.\n\nYour primary wound is not a life sentence. It's simply the belief system you've been operating from.

        "content": "In Module 1, you learned about parts—the fragmented aspects of yourself frozen in time. Now we're going to look at how your core wound created specific protective parts.\n\nUsing the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model, there are two types of protectors:\n\nMANAGERS: These parts work proactively to prevent your wound from ever being triggered. They control, plan, perfect, people-please, withdraw, or overachieve. Managers say: 'If I can just control everything, I'll never feel that wound again.'\n\nExamples:\n- Perfectionist (preventing humiliation)\n- People-pleaser (preventing rejection/abandonment)\n- Controller (preventing betrayal)\n- Achiever (proving you're not 'not enough')\n\nFIREFIGHTERS: These parts activate when your wound is triggered despite the managers' efforts. They numb, distract, or discharge the pain through impulsive behaviors. Firefighters say: 'I'll do anything to not feel this wound right now.'\n\nExamples:\n- Substance use\n- Binge eating or restriction\n- Rage outbursts\n- Sexual compulsion\n- Dissociation\n\nThese protectors are not bad. They saved you when you were too young to protect yourself. But now, as an adult, they often cause more harm than the original wound would. The key is not to eliminate protectors, but to update them—to let them know you're no longer a helpless child.",

They're reinforced across childhood through multiple experiences that confirm the same belief.\n\nToday, you'll create a wound timeline—a map of 3-5 significant moments where your core wound was formed or reinforced. This practice helps you see that your wound is not who you are; it's a belief system built over time.\n\nAs you identify these moments, look for the through-line—the recurring message your developing brain internalized:\n- 'See? I knew I wasn't enough.'\n- 'This proves I can't trust anyone.'\n- 'I knew I didn't belong.'\n\nThe wound doesn't care about the details of what happened. It only collects evidence for its core belief.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is not about blaming parents or caregivers. Most core wounds form not from malicious intent, but from unavoidable circumstances—a parent's own wounds, poverty, illness, absence, cultural conditioning. The goal is not to assign blame but to see clearly: This is where the belief came from. And if it came from outside me, it's not the truth of who I am.\n\nSeeing the pattern breaks its invisibility.

It's not self-indulgence ('I deserve to do whatever I want because I'm hurt'). It's also not spiritual bypassing ('Everything happens for a reason, so my wound is a gift').\n\nSelf-compassion, as defined by researcher Kristin Neff, has three components:\n\n1. SELF-KINDNESS: Treating yourself with the same tenderness you'd offer a hurt child. Speaking to your wounded parts with gentleness, not judgment.\n\n2. COMMON HUMANITY: Recognizing that core wounds are universal. You are not uniquely damaged. This is part of being human.\n\n3. MINDFULNESS: Holding your pain without exaggerating it or suppressing it. Not drowning in the wound, but not pretending it isn't there.\n\nThe wounded part of you is frozen in time, still living in that childhood moment. It doesn't know you're an adult now.

That's not failure—that's being human. The practice is noticing: 'Ah, I'm in my wound right now.' And then choosing, in that moment, to respond differently.\n\nThe work ahead is this: Make a conscious choice. Will you continue to let your wound run your life from the shadows?
