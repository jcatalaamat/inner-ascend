## 🎯 Immediate Big Wins (Pre-Launch)

### **Priority 0: Critical Launch Blockers** (2-3 days)

#### 1. 📅 Add to Calendar Integration
**Impact: 8/10 | Effort: 2 hours**

**Why it matters:**
- Users have NO way to commit to events
- They say "I'll remember" and never do
- This is the difference between discovery and attendance

**Implementation:**
```tsx
// Use expo-calendar or generate .ics files
import * as Calendar from 'expo-calendar';
// or
const icsFile = generateICS(event);
```

**Features:**
- "Add to Calendar" button on event details
- Include event location, organizer contact, description
- Auto-reminder 1 hour before
- Share calendar invite with friends

---

#### 2. ⚡ RSVP / "I'm Going" System
**Impact: 8/10 | Effort: 1 day**

**Why it's critical:**
- Organizers have ZERO feedback on interest
- Events look empty (no social proof)
- Can't notify attendees about changes
- No commitment mechanism

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE event_attendees (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('going', 'interested', 'maybe')) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(event_id, user_id)
);
```

**UI Changes:**
- Show "47 people going" on event cards
- Display attendee profile pictures (first 5)
- Filter by "Events I'm attending"
- Send updates to attendees

**Social proof effect:** This single number can 5x attendance

---

#### 3. 🔗 Deep Linking & Share Improvements
**Impact: 9/10 | Effort: 2 days**

**Current problem:**
- Share button creates dead-end text
- No way to open shared events directly in app
- Zero tracking of viral growth

**What to build:**
- Universal links: `mazunte.app/event/abc123`
- Instagram Story sharing with preview cards
- WhatsApp sharing with rich previews
- Track referral sources in PostHog

**Implementation:**
```tsx
// app.json
"expo": {
  "scheme": "mazunteconnect",
  "ios": {
    "associatedDomains": ["applinks:mazunte.app"]
  }
}
```

**Growth multiplier:** This unlocks viral distribution

---

## 🔥 Phase 1: Essential Features (Weeks 1-4)

### **Week 1: Retention Foundation**

#### 4. 🔔 Push Notifications (CRITICAL)
**Impact: 10/10 | Effort: 3-4 days**

**The retention killer:**
Without this, you'll see 92% churn by week 4. Users discover events AFTER they happen.

**Notification Types:**

**Time-based:**
- "Yoga ceremony tonight at 7pm 🧘" (1 hour before)
- "Don't forget: Cacao ceremony tomorrow" (1 day before)
- "This weekend in Mazunte 🌴" (Friday 5pm)

**Interest-based:**
- "New yoga event added" (when new event matches favorites)
- "5 new events this week" (weekly digest)

**Engagement-based:**
- "You haven't checked events in 3 days" (re-engagement)
- "3 events starting this week you might like"

**Admin/Organizer:**
- "Event location changed" (critical updates)
- "Event cancelled" (attendee notifications)

**Implementation:**
```bash
npx expo install expo-notifications
```

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE notification_preferences (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES profiles(id),
  event_reminders BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  new_events BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  weekly_digest BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  organizer_updates BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  categories JSONB -- ['yoga', 'ceremony']
);

CREATE TABLE push_tokens (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  token TEXT NOT NULL,
  platform TEXT CHECK (platform IN ('ios', 'android', 'web')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, token)
);
```

**Must-have features:**
- User controls in settings
- Category preferences
- Quiet hours (10pm-8am)
- Test notification button

---

### **Week 2: Trust & Safety**

#### 5. 💬 Reviews & Ratings System
**Impact: 9/10 | Effort: 4-5 days**

**The trust problem:**
In Mazunte's spiritual scene, there are sketchy operators. Without reviews, users can't distinguish authentic experiences from scams.

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  item_id UUID NOT NULL, -- event or place ID
  item_type TEXT CHECK (item_type IN ('event', 'place')),
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  title TEXT,
  comment TEXT,
  photos JSONB, -- array of image URLs
  attended_date DATE, -- proof they went
  helpful_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  verified_attendee BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  flagged BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_item ON reviews(item_id, item_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_user ON reviews(user_id);
```

**Features:**

**For attendees:**
- Star rating (1-5)
- Written review with photos
- "Would recommend" checkbox
- Mark review as helpful

**UI/UX:**
- Show average rating on event/place cards
- Sort reviews: Most helpful, Recent, Highest/Lowest
- Filter by rating
- "Verified attendee" badge

---

#### 6. 🚨 Report & Moderation System
**Impact: 7/10 | Effort: 2 days**

**Why you need this:**
- Scam events will appear
- Inappropriate content will be posted
- Harassment can occur
- You need liability protection

**Report types:**
- Spam/Scam
- Inappropriate content
- Misleading information
- Harassment
- Duplicate listing
- Wrong category

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE reports (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  reporter_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  item_id UUID NOT NULL,
  item_type TEXT CHECK (item_type IN ('event', 'place', 'review', 'user')),
  reason TEXT CHECK (reason IN ('spam', 'inappropriate', 'misleading', 'harassment', 'duplicate', 'other')),
  description TEXT,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'investigating', 'resolved', 'dismissed')) DEFAULT 'pending',
  resolved_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  resolution_notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  resolved_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

**Features:**

- Email alerts for new reports

---

### **Week 3: Discovery & Personalization**

#### 7. 🎯 Smart Recommendations Engine
**Impact: 8/10 | Effort: 3 days**

**Use your PostHog data:**
You're already tracking favorites, views, shares. Use it!

**Recommendation algorithms:**

**1. Category-based:**
```sql
-- Events similar to what you favorited
SELECT e.* FROM events e
WHERE e.category IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT item_type FROM favorites
  WHERE user_id = $1 AND item_type = 'event'
)
AND e.id NOT IN (SELECT item_id FROM favorites WHERE user_id = $1)
ORDER BY e.date ASC;
```

**2. Popularity-based:**
```sql
-- Trending events (most RSVPs this week)
SELECT e.*, COUNT(ea.id) as attendee_count
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN event_attendees ea ON ea.event_id = e.id
WHERE e.date >= NOW()
GROUP BY e.id
ORDER BY attendee_count DESC, e.date ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

**3. Location-based:**
- Events near places you've favorited
- Events at venues you've attended before

**4. Social proof:**
- "3 people you know are going"
- "Popular with yoga lovers"

**UI Components:**
- "Recommended for You" section on home
- "Because you liked..." explanations

---

#### 8. 🔍 Advanced Search & Filters
