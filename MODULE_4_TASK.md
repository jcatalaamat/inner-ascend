## Content Structure (per day)

Each day needs:

```json
{
  "day": 1,
  "title": "Day title here",
  "teaching": {
    "heading": "2-4 word heading for the teaching",
    "content": "2-4 paragraphs of teaching content (300-500 words). Psychologically rigorous, accessible language, trauma-informed.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "4-6 key takeaways as bullet points",
      "Each 5-15 words"
    ]
  },
  "practice": {
    "type": "meditation | journaling | somatic | visualization",
    "title": "Practice name",
    "duration": 10-30,
    "description": "Full practice instructions (100-200 words). Actionable, clear, safe."
  },
  "journaling": {
    "prompt": "Main journaling prompt (1-2 sentences, italic-worthy)",
    "questions": [
      "3-4 reflection questions",
      "Open-ended, introspective"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Quality Standards

### Teaching Content Must:
- Be **psychologically rigorous** - Reference real frameworks (IFS, attachment theory, developmental psychology)
- Use **accessible language** - No jargon without explanation
- Be **trauma-informed** - Never victim-blaming, always compassionate
- **Build on previous modules** - Reference Parts Work (M1), Core Wounds (M2), Shadow Work (M3)
- **Progress logically** - Each day builds on the previous

### Practice Types to Vary:
- **Visualization**: Meeting inner child at different ages (Days 3-6)
- **Journaling**: Deep inquiry, timeline work
- **Somatic**: Body-based inner child work (Day 11)
- **Meditation**: Loving-kindness, reparenting meditations
- **Dialogue**: Written conversations with child parts (Day 12)

### Key Psychological Frameworks to Reference:
- **Attachment Theory** (Bowlby, Ainsworth): Secure, anxious, avoidant, disorganized
- **IFS (Internal Family Systems)**: Child parts (exiles), how they differ from protectors
- **Developmental Psychology**: Needs at each age stage (Erikson, Piaget)
- **Reparenting** (Capacchione, Bradshaw): Becoming the parent you needed
- **Somatic Inner Child Work** (Lawrence): Body memories from childhood

## Pedagogical Arc (14 Days)

**Days 1-2: Foundation**
- What is inner child work? Why it matters
- Developmental trauma explained
- Attachment styles and how they formed

**Days 3-6: Meeting Different Ages**
- Infant (0-2): Safety, trust, attunement needs
- Toddler (2-4): Autonomy, boundaries, emotional regulation
- Child (5-7): Creativity, play, belonging, approval
- Adolescent (12-18): Identity, independence, peer connection

**Days 7-9: Reparenting**
- What your inner child needed but didn't get
- How to become your own good parent
- Healing attachment wounds through self-relationship

**Days 10-12: Integration & Practice**
- Inner child in daily life (when does child part get triggered?)
- Somatic approaches (body holds child memories)
- Dialoguing with child parts (IFS-style)

**Days 13-14: Completion**
- Integrating all child parts into adult self
- Commitment to ongoing reparenting
- Preparing for Module 5 (Somatic Release)

## Connection to Other Modules

**Builds on**:
- Module 1: Parts Work â†’ Inner child parts are specific "exiles" from IFS
- Module 2: Core Wounds â†’ Wounds formed in childhood, now you meet the child who was wounded
- Module 3: Shadow Work â†’ Child parts often carry the shadow (disowned vulnerability, playfulness, neediness)

**Prepares for**:
- Module 5: Somatic Release â†’ Inner child memories are stored in the body
- Module 8: Shame & Vulnerability â†’ Inner child often carries shame
- Module 9: Grief & Loss â†’ Grieving the childhood you didn't have

## Tone & Style

- **Compassionate but not saccharine** - This is real work, not just "hug your inner child"
- **Challenging but not overwhelming** - Meeting child parts can be intense
- **Practical and actionable** - Every teaching has clear practices
- **Trauma-informed** - Acknowledge this can be triggering, offer grounding
- **Universal yet specific** - Examples span different backgrounds, genders, cultures

## Example Quality (from Module 2, Day 1)

```json
{
  "day": 1,
  "title": "What is a Core Wound?",
  "teaching": {
    "heading": "Understanding Core Wounds",
    "content": "A core wound is not just a bad memory. It's a belief about yourself that was formed before you had language to question it.\n\nMost core wounds form between ages 0-7, in moments when your developing brain needed to make sense of confusing or painful experiences. You were too young to think, 'My parent is having a hard day and is projecting their stress onto me.' Instead, you thought, 'I did something wrong. I am bad.'\n\nThat beliefâ€”'I am bad,' 'I am not enough,' 'I am unlovable,' 'I cannot trust'â€”became your core wound. It settled into your nervous system, your body, your sense of self. And from that day forward, you filtered reality through that belief.\n\nCore wounds are not your fault. They are the result of a child's brain trying to survive in an imperfect world. But now, as an adult, they run your life from the shadows. They determine how you react to criticism, how you show up in relationships, what you believe you deserve, and what you're afraid to risk.\n\nThe good news: What was learned can be unlearned. What was formed can be reformed. But first, you must identify the wound. You must bring it into the light. That's the work of this module.",
    "keyPoints": [
      "Core wounds are pre-verbal beliefs formed in early childhood",
      "They're survival responses, not truth",
      "They filter how you perceive reality as an adult",
      "Identifying your wound is the first step to freedom"
    ]
  },
  "practice": {
    "type": "meditation",
    "title": "Body Scan for Protection Patterns",
    "duration": 15,
    "description": "Lie down comfortably. Bring awareness to your body. Where do you feel tension? Tightness? Guarding? Your body knows where your wounds liveâ€”they're the places you protect. Breathe into each area. Ask: 'What are you protecting me from?' Listen without judgment."
  },
  "journaling": {
    "prompt": "When I feel 'not enough,' 'unlovable,' or 'unsafe,' what age do I feel like? What does that younger version of me need to hear?",
    "questions": [
      "What beliefs about myself do I hold that I've never questioned?",
      "If I trace my deepest fear back to childhood, what event or pattern do I find?",
      "What would my life look like if I didn't believe this wound was true?"
    ]
  }
}
```
