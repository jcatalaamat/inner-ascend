That you don't lie to yourself trying to hide some aspect of you.\n\nIn order to see the light, you must shade the darkness. In order to shade the darkness, you must accept it.\n\nThese aspects are fragments of you, frozen in time, still reliving the situation that split them from you in the first place.
